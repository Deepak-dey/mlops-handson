# 🚀 MLOps, LLMOps & AIOps Hands-on Journey

A step-by-step implementation repository tracking my hands-on journey through the full lifecycle of traditional machine learning (MLOps), large language models (LLMOps), and AI for IT operations (AIOps).

I am building this sequentially, starting from core ML model training and scaling up to automated production pipelines.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Architecture

### 🏗️ Phase 1: MLOps (Current Focus)

Building the foundational automation pipeline for traditional machine learning.

- **Model Training:** Taxi trip duration regression with experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering.
- **Experiment Tracking & Model Management:** MLflow for logging runs, comparing metrics, and managing the best model.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated testing for data, code, and model artifacts.
- **Deployment:** Containerized microservices using Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Monitoring:** Drift detection and automated model retraining triggers.

### 🤖 Phase 2: LLMOps (Upcoming)

Scaling operational practices to generative AI and LLMs.

- **Prompt Engineering:** Versioning and tracking optimal prompt templates.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Efficient fine-tuning loops (LoRA/QLoRA) with resource tracking.
- **Vector DBs & RAG:** Retrieval-augmented generation pipelines.
- **Evaluation & Guardrails:** Tracking hallucination metrics, latency, and token costs.

### 🧠 Phase 3: AIOps (Upcoming)

Applying AI to optimize system operations and infrastructure.

- **Log Anomaly Detection:** Real-time processing of system logs to flag failures.
- **Predictive Scaling:** Forecasting infrastructure load to scale resources.
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Automated telemetry tracking to isolate system bugs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, PyTorch

## 🧪 Experiment Tracking & Model Selection

**Problem:** Regression task predicting taxi trip duration (in minutes) from pickup/dropoff locations and trip distance. Duration is derived from the pickup and dropoff timestamps, and trips outside 1 to 60 minutes are filtered out.

**Approach:**

1. Train baseline models (Linear Regression, Lasso) and log them to MLflow.
2. Train an XGBoost regressor and tune it with Hyperopt (`fmin` with the TPE algorithm).
3. Log every Hyperopt trial as an MLflow run with its parameters and validation RMSE.
4. Pick the run with the lowest validation RMSE and manage that model in MLflow.

**Results:**

| Model | Validation RMSE |
|---|---|
| Linear Regression | 216.91246617869817 |
| Lasso (alpha=0.01) | 216.9898679834695 |
| XGBoost + Hyperopt (best run) | 52.62305317090367 |

### Finding the best model

```python
import mlflow

client = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()
best_run = client.search_runs(
    experiment_ids=["<experiment_id>"],
    order_by=["metrics.rmse ASC"],
    max_results=1,
)[0]
print(best_run.info.run_id, best_run.data.metrics["rmse"])
```

### Registering the best model

```python
mlflow.register_model(
    model_uri=f"runs:/{best_run.info.run_id}/models",
    name="taxi-duration-predictor",
)
```

### Viewing experiments

```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:5000 to compare runs, sort by RMSE, and inspect the registered model.

## 🏃 How to Run the Current Iteration

### Prerequisites

Python 3.10+ and `venv` installed.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deepak-dey/mlops-handson
   cd mlops-handson
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the MLflow tracking server (in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db
   ```

5. Run the training script (baseline models, then XGBoost with Hyperopt):
   ```bash
   python src/mlops/train.py
   ```

6. Open the MLflow UI and sort runs by `rmse` to see the best model.
